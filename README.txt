Evil Australians is a video game developed by me, gameblabla.
It's a platforming arena game made from scratch with the help of my own library, Gameblabla's Wrapper.
The game has several missions and in each mission, you are stuck in an arena where
you must defeat all the remaining enemies.
To defeat the enemies, you have a rapid-fire gun that can shoot several bullets at the same time.
